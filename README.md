# Todo List

## Current Status:

Under development.

## Motivation

Part of my journey learning to create web apps. This part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript course. This project in particular has the purpose of using factory functions or constructors/classes to build a todo list app using basic OOP principles - SOLID principles, mainly focused on the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Development

### To-do:

- [ ] Create the localStorage module - its main purpose is to get, set and delete data from localStorage;
- [ ] Create the Task module - its aim is to implement CRUD functionalities for tasks;
- [ ] Create the Project module - its aim is to implement CRUD functionalities for projects;
- [ ] Create basic UI in a separate DOM module - it should be able to do the following: view all projects, view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate), expand a single todo to see/edit its details and delete a todo.
